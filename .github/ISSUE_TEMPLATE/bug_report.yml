    label: Tested with only WeakAuras
    description: |
      Sometimes, other addons can interfere with WeakAuras. We recommend testing with only WeakAuras enabled to see if the issue persists.
      You can use the [Bisector Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bisector) to make this easier. After installing that addon:
      1. Type in game: `/bisect start +WeakAuras !WeakAurasCompanion`. Your UI should reload.
      2. Test if the issue is still present:
        - **YES** Type `/bisect bad`. A window should appear with some text. Copy that text and paste it in the Bisector Report field below.
        - **NO** Type `/bisect good`. A window should appear with some text. You can either:
          - Copy that text and paste it in the Bisector Report field below.
          - Type `/bisect continue` to try to find which addon is causing the issue. Follow the prompts that Bisector prints in your chat.
      3. Type in game `/bisect reset` to restore your addons to their original state.
    options:
      - I got this issue with only WeakAuras enabled
      - I have a Bisector Report

      Do you have an error log of what happened? If you don't see any errors, make sure that error reporting is enabled (`/console scriptErrors 1`) or install [BugSack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bugsack) & [BugGrabber](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bug-grabber), yes both are needed.
      Note that if the error looks like `[string "--[[ Error in ' my awesome aura' ]` then the bug is in the aura that got mentioned, not in WeakAuras itself.
