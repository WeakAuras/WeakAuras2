<!-- What did you expect to happen and what happened instead? -->

**Do you have an error log of what happened?**
<!-- If you don't see any errors, make sure that error reporting is enabled (`/console scriptErrors 1`) or install https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bugsack & https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bug-grabber, yes both are needed.
Note that if the error looks like `[string "--[[ Error in ' my awesome aura' ]` then the bug is in the aura that got mentioned, not in WeakAuras itself -->
