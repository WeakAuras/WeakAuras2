WeakAuras is a powerful and flexible framework that allows you to display highly customizable graphics on your screen to indicate buffs, debuffs, and a whole host of similar types of information. It was originally meant to be a lightweight replacement for Power Auras, but it now incorporates many features that Power Auras does not, while still remaining more efficient and easy to use.

Features include:
* An intuitive and powerful configuration interface
* Custom textures including all textures from Power Auras and the new Cataclysm spell alerts
* Progress bars and textures that show the exact duration of auras
* Displays based on auras, health, power (mana, rage, soul shards, holy power, etc.), cooldowns, combat events, runes, totems, items, and many other triggers
* Preset and user-defined animations
* Custom side-effects such as chat announcements or sounds
* Grouping, which allows multiple displays to be positioned and configured at the same time
* CPU optimizations such as conditional loading/unloading of displays, modularity, and prevention of full aura scanning
* Powerful customization options, such as animation paths, on-show/on-hide code, and custom triggers, for Lua-savvy users

To open the options window, type "*/wa*" or "*/weakauras*" into your chat.

*Note:* WeakAuras works better with more media!
