# WeakAuras 2

WeakAuras is a powerful and flexible framework that allows the display of highly customizable graphics on World of Warcraft's user interface to indicate buffs, debuffs, and other relevant information. This addon was created to be a lightweight replacement for Power Auras but has since introduced more functionalities while remaining efficient and easy to use.


## Features

* An intuitive and powerful configuration interface
* Custom textures including all textures from Power Auras and Blizzard's spell alerts
* Progress bars and textures that show the exact duration of auras
* Displays based on auras, health, power (mana, rage, soul shards, holy power, etc.), cooldowns, combat events, runes, totems, items, and many other triggers
* Preset and user-defined animations
* Custom side-effects such as chat announcements or sounds
* Grouping, which allows multiple displays to be positioned and configured at the same time
* CPU optimizations such as conditional loading/unloading of displays, modularity, and prevention of full aura scanning
* Powerful customization options, such as animation paths, on-show/on-hide code, and custom triggers, for Lua-savvy users

## Quick Start

To open the options window, type `/wa` or `/weakauras` into your chat and hit enter or use the minimap icon.

## Extensions

* [WeakAuras Companion](https://weakauras.wtf): This application adds the missing link between Wago.io and the World of Warcraft addon, enabling you to update your auras in a convenient fashion.
* [WeakAuras_StopMotion](https://www.wowace.com/addons/weakauras-stop-motion): This addon adds a new region type to WeakAuras that allows for stop motion animations. Stop Motion textures contain each frame of the animation as a separate image. The addon ships with a number of animations and it supports custom textures.
* [SharedMedia](https://www.wowace.com/addons/sharedmedia) for more bar textures.
* [SharedMediaAdditionalFonts](https://www.wowace.com/addons/shared-media-additional-fonts) for more fonts.
* [ColorPickerPlus](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/colorpickerplus) for a better version of the WoW color picker that includes class color templates and a copy and paste function.
